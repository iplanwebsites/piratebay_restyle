# Pirate Bay Theme

The second ugliest website of the internet (after craigslist) gets a facelift. 

It's more a patch than anything else because I can't touch the (horrible) markup nor add some clever Javascript. 

Feel free to extend/fix it, I spent very little time on this project.

Do I need to mention I'd love to see this design used on thepiratebay.se!!!

# Use in chrome and Firefox

It might takes a long time before the folks at TPB fixes the site, and they may never touch it as many got used to its flaws and wouldn't want change anyway.

You can however install this thepiratebay.se stylesheet in your browser to override the default styles:
