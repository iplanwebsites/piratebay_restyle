# Pirate Bay Theme

The second ugliest website of the internet gets a fix. 

It's more a patch than anything else because I can't touch the (horrible) markup nor add some clever Javascript. 

Feel free to extend/fix it, I spent very little time on this project.

Do I need to mention I'd love to see this design rolled on TPB!!!
